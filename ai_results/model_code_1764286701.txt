Sure, here is an example of how you could create the HTML file for your WebGL project using Three.js library to display a solar system in three dimensions (WebGL). This code assumes that you have already set up and configured Your environment properly on any web server or local development machine with Node Package Manager(npm) installed, as well setup an HTTP Server if required by the browser's CORS policy:

```html

```   This HTML file will create an interactive, three-dimensional view of the solar system using WebGL in Three.js library by default including all elements necessary such as bodies (like planets and sun), lights etc., that are rendered to your browser canvas for visualization purposes which you can navigate through different parts depending on what is required from a user or programmer's perspective with JavaScript, HTML & CSS knowledge level up requirements of the project.
