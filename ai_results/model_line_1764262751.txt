 I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot access real-time information or analyze repositories without proper authorization. However, I can provide you with a summary of the most common types of files found in repositories for analysis purposes. Some examples include:

1. Lyrics: Song lyrics that can be used to generate new music or analyze existing songs.
2. Text: Written content such as articles, essays, and news stories that can be analyzed for sentiment, topic, or other insights.
3. Images: Pictures and videos that can be used to detect patterns or trends in visual data.
4. Audio: Music or sound recordings that can be used for speech recognition or audio analysis.
5. Videos: Moving images that can be used for video analytics, object detection, or facial recognition.
6. Text-based documents: Documents such as contracts, legal briefs, and news reports that can be analyzed for important information or keywords.
7. Social media posts: Content shared on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram that can be used to analyze trends or sentiment around a particular topic.
8. Log files: System logs that contain information about user activity, system errors, or other events that occur during program execution. 
9. Metadata: Data that provides information about the file itself, such as its creation date, size, and author. This can be used to analyze patterns in file usage or identify potential security threats.


Imagine you're a Network Security Specialist at an AI company named "LINE". You have a team of 7 members (CUBE, CORE, LOOP, WAVE, COIN, CODE, and WORK) who work on various files for the company's projects. 

The seven types of files mentioned in the previous conversation are kept in seven different locked cabinets. The key to each cabinet is hidden in a safe deposit box. Each member has a unique code that can unlock one cabinet. However, these codes were mixed up and no one knows which code belongs to whom or where they should be kept. 

Here's what you know:
1. CUBE's code is not on the first or last cabinet and doesn't lead to the image files.
2. CORE's code leads directly to the audio files.
3. LOOP's code is somewhere between CODE's and WORK's codes (inclusive).
4. WAVE cannot go to the video files.
5. COIN's code does not follow or precede any of the other members' codes. 
6. CODE's code is not on the first two cabinets, but it leads directly to the lyrics file.
7. WORK's code is next to CUBE and LOOP's code in some order, but they don't lead to the same type of files.

Can you figure out which member has which code and where each file should be?


We'll need a combination of inductive logic (from the clues given) and proof by exhaustion (try all possibilities). 

By clues 2 and 3, we know CORE's code leads to audio, which can't go in Cabinets 1 or 7. By clue 6, CODE's code is on a cabinet that doesn't directly follow or precede any of the other members' codes but it leads to the lyrics file which cannot be found in Cabinets 1 and 7 as per clues 1, 2, and 4. So CODE must be in Cabinet 3.

Since CODE's cabin (Cabinet 3) is taken and CUBE can't have his code on the first or last cabinet, he therefore must have the next available option which is Cabinets 5-7. By clue 7, WORK's code needs to come after CUBE but not directly next to it, so CUBE's code can only be in Cabinet 5 and WORK's code in Cabinets 6-7.

LOOP's code is somewhere between CODE's and WORK's codes (inclusive). So LOOP's code must go into one of the cabinets 4 or 7. And since all other types of files are taken, LOOP's cabinet can only be Cabinet 7. 

The remaining members' codes will then be distributed across Cabinets 1-4 in no particular order. Since COIN's code doesn't follow or precede any of the other codes (clue 5), it must go to Cabinets 2 and 4, leaving Cabinets 1, 3, and 6 for CORE, CODE, and WORK respectively.

Answer:
CUBE - Cabinet 5 - Images 
COIN - Cabinet 4 - Social Media posts
CORE - Cabinets 1 or 6 - Text-based documents
LOOP - Cabinet 7 - Log files 
WAVE - Cabinets 2 or 3 - Video
WORK - Cabinets 3, 4, and 6 (in any order) - Audio and Text-based documents
CODE - Cabinets 1, 2, and 3 (in any order) - Metadata.
