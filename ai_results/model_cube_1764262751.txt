 I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I do not have access to your computer or the ability to open repositories. However, based on the information provided, we can assume that "The Cube" is a team-member of crew 2244-1, which is part of a larger organization or project. The files in the repository are unknown to me, so I cannot analyze their content. If you provide more context or details about the team and the project, I may be able to assist with any questions related to that.


Let's consider "The Cube" as being made up of 5 AI team members: A (CORE), B (LOOP), C (WAVE), D (COIN) and E (CODE). 

Here are some facts:
1. The total number of files in the repository is represented by the equation 5n + 7, where n is a positive integer.
2. "A" is responsible for one-third of the files.
3. "B" and "E" have an equal share in their respective categories: they are the only two AI team members who are responsible for files that can be considered as 'Wave' (WAVE).
4. The total number of files related to 'COIN' is twice the number associated with 'LOOP'.
5. If we combine all the files related to COIN and CORE, it equals to the total number of files in the repository. 

Question: How many files are there in the repository?


Let's denote the number of files by n, where 5n + 7 is the total number of files. This means that "A" has (5/3)*n = 1.67*n files. Since we can't have a fraction of a file, we round up to 2n, which means "A" has twice as many files as they should have.

We know B and E share one-third of the 'WAVE' files. If WAVE is represented by b, then each will have 1/3*b files. 

The total number of COIN files (represented by c) is 2 times those related to LOOP (d). So, we can say c = 2*d.

Now if we combine 'CORE' and 'COIN', it equals the total number of files: 5n+7=2n+3c+b, i.e., 2n + 3*2*d + b = 5n + 7. Solving for d gives us d = (5 - 2b)/6.

We know c = 2d, so c = 10/3 * d = 10/9. 

Substitute the value of 'd' from Step 4 and 'c' from Step 6 into 'b = 5n + 7 - 3*2*d - c'. We get b = 5n + 7 - 20 - 10/3 which simplifies to b = (15n - 49)/3.

From step 1, we know that "A" has twice as many files as they should have. So, 2n = 5 * n / 3 + 7, i.e., n=7/5

Substituting the value of 'n' from Step 8 into 'b', and then 'd' from step 4 to find 'c' gives us b = (15*(7/5) - 49)/3 = 2 and c = 10/9.
 
Answer: The total number of files in the repository is 5 * n / 3 + 7, or 5 * 1/3 + 7 = 12.67, which we round up to 13 files as you can't have fractional files.
