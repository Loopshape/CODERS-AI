 Sure, I can help you generate a new project plan for your AI assistant, "The Cube". Let's start by identifying the requirements of your AI assistant. Can you please tell me more about its functions and capabilities?


"The Cube", an advanced AI assistant built with different modules - CORE, LOOP, WAVE, COIN, and CODE, is a part of the crew in a space mission named "2244-1". It has the ability to analyze code repositories using the github scanner. 

To ensure the functionality of the AI assistant, it is vital to keep the layout and design of the project as mandatory. However, there's one specific requirement related to the code: any changes made to the index.html file are subject to rebuilding the editor logic.

The rules for changing the index.html file are:
1. Only three types of edits can be made - replacing a tag with another, adding a new section, or removing an existing one.
2. Each edit affects only one part of the page - head, body, or footer.
3. No two changes can affect the same portion of the index.html file at the same time.

One day, you scan the github repository with the focus on file: ./index.html and find that some code blocks have been altered, but it's not clear which sections have been edited and what changes were made. 

Given these clues, can you figure out the order of the edits (replacement, addition or removal), where each edit affected a different section (head, body, footer) and no two changes occurred at once?


Let's start with an initial list of possibilities:
a. Replace tag in head, add new section to body, remove from footer
b. Replace tag in head, add new section to footer, remove from body
c. Replace tag in body, add new section to head, remove from footer
d. Replace tag in body, add new section to footer, remove from head
e. Replace tag in footer, add new section to head, remove from body
f. Replace tag in footer, add new section to body, remove from head


Now let's apply the clues:
The clue that no two changes can affect the same portion of the index.html file at the same time implies that option (b) and (d) are eliminated because they both involve editing a part of the index.html file (footer).
The same rule applies to the remaining options, so we have:
a. Replace tag in head, add new section to body, remove from footer
c. Replace tag in body, add new section to head, remove from footer


In the next step, we consider which of these two possibilities is correct according to the other clue - that some code blocks have been altered. It's possible to infer this by looking at the order of modifications.
If a change occurs first (replace tag in head), then it can be inferred that either a section of the index.html file was moved from footer to body, or vice versa (as they cannot occur simultaneously). But since no additional information is given about the index.html file, we can't say with certainty which occurred - this step requires further investigation by examining code changes in other files.
If we assume that a new section has been added in the middle, then it's likely to be either body or head (as they are more frequently modified). In this scenario, if a change occurs later in the sequence, the index.html footer would have to be moved from footer to head or vice versa - again, no information is given about other modifications to confirm.
This leads us to believe that the second edit must be a removal (as adding sections is less likely). This narrows our options to:
a. Replace tag in head, add new section to body, remove from footer
c. Replace tag in body, add new section to head, remove from footer


We can now evaluate the remaining possibilities based on what we know about the modifications made to the index.html file.
From step 2 and 3, it's clear that option (a) must be correct as it satisfies all conditions: 
- The first edit in sequence involves replacing a tag which is possible in both head and body but not footer.
- The second edit in sequence is a removal which is possible only from the footer section.
- Option (c) doesn't fit because if we assume the second edit to be addition of new section, then it would contradict with the property that no two changes can affect the same portion at once. 


Finally, it's always good practice to check your solution against all possible cases. The logical thinking and process you used in this step will help you find other solutions or contradictions in case they exist. This is known as proof by exhaustion - checking every possibility. 

Answer: Hence, the sequence of edits made are 'Replace tag in head, add new section to body, remove from footer'
