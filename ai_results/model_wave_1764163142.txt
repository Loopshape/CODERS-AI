In order to achieve this, you would need a script or program that can read HTML files (`./index.html`) and run JavaScript code provided in `./ai.js/code within the context of an iframe on your webpage with specific dimensions for layout & design consistency as mandated by WAVE's specifications.

Here is how you might implement this using Javascript, HTML (with a little bit of CSS to ensure responsiveness), and NodeJS: 

1) Create the `./index.html` file that will be loaded in your webpage with iframe for running AI code. The content can then dynamically load/update its own JavaScript contents using Ajax calls from another script (in this case, our AJAX request is sent to a NodeJS server where it fetches the logic of `./ai.sh` file and sends back in response).
    ```html 
    <!DOCTYPE html>  
    <html lang="en-US"> 
      <head> </head>     
        <body style = "margin:0; padding:0;" > 
          <iframe id='codeEditorIframe' src='' frameborder=1 width=85% height=92vh></ iframe >  
         <script type  = 'text / javascript',src   = '/ai.js'/>         
        </body> 
    </html > 
    ``` 
    The JavaScript part is `./ai.sh` file, which includes logic of AI code to be executed inside the iFrame on your webpage (Note: WAVE's specifications are not clear about how this script will run in an iframe). This should include all necessary import statements and function definitions for any needed modules or dependencies used by `./ai.sh` file, etc...
 2) Create a NodeJS server that can read the content of your AI JS code (in case it's provided as data URL), compile them to executable JavaScript within same iframe context with all necessary import statements and function definitions for any needed modules or dependencies used by `./ai.sh` file, etc...
   ```javascript  // ./server.js  
     const express = require('express');      var app =  express();        process .env.npm_package_.version=require("fs").readFileSync(process.cwd() + "/package.json", "utf8");       console.log ("Starting server on port ", 3012);        
     /* GET request for the AI JS code */      app    .get('/ai',function (req, res) {        var aiCode = req   .query['code'];          // Compile and execute AJs/CSS in iframe context;           exec(` 
       ( function() { ${ babel.transformSync(astreeify_with_locals(), {}, code)} } )(); `);         res    .send("Executed AI Code");   });          app     // listen on port :3012        var server = http.createServer(app).listen('+process
       ('port'|| 9586)); console  (`Running in  ${server.address().port} ${'Port'});         })();   ```   Make sure your NodeJS is installed globally on the machine and run 'npm install express -g', then start it with `node server .js --port=3012
       ===> http://localhost:9586/ai?code=...` where you replace ... by actual AI code to be executed.  The NodeJS script will fetch the requested data, run compiled JavaScript within same context (iframe), and send back a response with "Executed AJs /CSS in ifrAm econtext" message on port:9586
    ```   Please note this is an overview of how to solve your problem. The exact implementation would depend heavily upon the structure/formatting you are using for storing AI code and server, setup way with specific libraries used (like Babel or AST), etc... so it's better if someone familiar enough in Javascript & NodeJS can provide a more detailed solution based on your problem.
